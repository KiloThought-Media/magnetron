UPDATES

September 27, 2014

We're working on the pre-alpha versions of a powerful support infrastructure ideal for providing a better user experience to clients. The goal, like most (all?) good UI design, is to maintain simplicity and make it 100% easy for the client to pick up and use. Using the system should not feel like a chore or a task really at all.

It should pull in all possible remotely support-related features (including things like website SEO reports) like a MAGNET in one location. Progress on this earlier in 2014 was delayed as our agency became very busy. We are thus still in the idea process but more updates may arrive on this repository very soon.
